## 🌐 Overview

**RadarLite** is a radar-like environmental scanning system that uses an **ESP32-C6 Mini**, a **continuous rotation servo**, and an **ultrasonic sensor** to detect objects in a 360° field. The sensor captures distance data as it rotates forward and backward, and transmits this data via serial communication to a **Processing** app, which visualizes the scanned environment in real time.

> Compact, responsive, and ideal for real-time visualization of physical spaces in robotics and embedded systems research.

| Component                      | Description                                 |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **ESP32-C6 Mini**             | Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller (ESP chip)    |
| **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** | Measures distance to nearby objects         |
| **Continuous Servo Motor**    | Rotates sensor continuously in both directions |
| **Processing**                | Visualizes sensor data as radar scans       |
| **Arduino CLI**               | Command-line firmware flashing              |
| **Linux (antiX)**             | Lightweight Debian-based development OS     |

## 🔁 How It Works

1. **Rotation Logic:** Servo motor rotates the ultrasonic sensor across ~360°.
2. **Sensing:** At time-based angular steps, HC-SR04 records distance values.
3. **Data Stream:** (angle, distance) data pairs are sent via USB serial.
4. **Visualization:** Processing app receives serial data and plots a radar sweep in real time.
